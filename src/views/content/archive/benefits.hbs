  <li><strong>Save time</strong> by getting the proper specification and action plan <strong>faster</strong> instead of wasting time of multiple people in lengthy discussions without methodology and expertise.</li>
  <li><strong>Save money</strong> for senior developers since the tech specs are already well thought and provided.</li>
  <li><strong>Clear out</strong> logical bugs or catch-22 cases in the system before it is programmed.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicate freely</strong> in your domain language and professional slang and <strong>be on the same page</strong> with the other participants.</li>
  <li>Get <strong>streamlined UX</strong> towards the user goals.</li>
  <li>Get flexibility of the features and data to have options for <strong>future expansions</strong> of the system.</li>
  <li>Get an objective yardstick to measure both the <strong>quality</strong> of the produced code and the <strong>performance</strong> of each developer so that deviations can be spotted on the day or maximum on the day after, instead of months later.</li>
